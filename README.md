# Idea for a use case of the NeTV2
A project that would be very interesting to implement (assuming it were possible without getting in trouble with the 17 U.S. Code ยง 1201) would be to use a project like the NeTV2 to scan a stream of content from your television to detect what actors, directors, etc are involved in a show\movie you are watching to be able to overlay a bitcoin wallet to each artist allowing the viewer to pay the artist directly for the content they are watching. 

For example: If I am watching one of my favorite shows Halt and Catch Fire and I get particularly inspired by the acting of Mackenzie Davis in Episode 10 of Season 3, I would like to be able to send her 50 cents worth of bitcoin by just pausing the episode on a scene that she appears and have the NeTV2 use facial recognition to detect who it is and do a lookup for a bitcoin wallet she has verified is owned by her. The NeTV2 could then overlay the QR code with the bitcoin wallet address next to Mackenzie Davis. This can also work using Optical Character Recognition during the credits. A tool like this could also allow me to split my payment between every make up artist, set designer, and wardrobe designer involved in the episode.

# Why?
This would give artists another stream of income and allow viewers to connect with actors, designers, or directors in a new way. 

# What else?
This could open a new avenue to interactivity in media consumption for example it could be expanded so during the end credits after a movie is finished one could see other movies or tv shows currently playing that includes the actor in the movie or tv show you just finished watching.

This could also allow the viewer to pause a scene and have information about piece of painting in the background or information on an ad in a billboard in the background be overlayed allowing the viewer to learn more about the content in the world of the movie or tv show they are watching.
